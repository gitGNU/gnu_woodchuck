debug output
------------

There are 6 debugging levels (0-5).  By default, levels 0-3 are
logged.  The debugging output level should be choosen as follows:

 0: should definately be seen
 1: warning (something went wrong, but we can continue)
 2: high-priority informational (even if --quiet is passed)
 3: low-priority informational (default)
 4: verbose
 5: core dump

dbus interfaces
---------------

To get an XML description of an interface using introspection:

  # dbus-send --system --print-reply \
    --dest=org.freedesktop.NetworkManager \
    /org/freedesktop/NetworkManager \
    org.freedesktop.DBus.Introspectable.Introspect \
    > org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.xml

You'll need to edit the resulting file to get rid of some text that
dbus-send adds when printing the message and to select just the
interfaces that you need.

To generate client stubs for glib, use dbus-binding-tool:

  # dbus-binding-tool --mode=glib-client org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.xml \
    > org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.h

The methods have the interface's prefix (in this case
org_freedesktop_Networkmanager_*).
