To get an XML description of an interface using introspection:

  # dbus-send --system --print-reply \
    --dest=org.freedesktop.NetworkManager \
    /org/freedesktop/NetworkManager \
    org.freedesktop.DBus.Introspectable.Introspect \
    > org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.xml

You'll need to edit the resulting file to get rid of some text that
dbus-send adds when printing the message and to select just the
interfaces that you need.

To generate client stubs for glib, use dbus-binding-tool:

  # dbus-binding-tool --mode=glib-client org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.xml \
    > org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.h

The methods have the interface's prefix (in this case
org_freedesktop_Networkmanager_*).
